We decide to use stratified 10-fold cross validation. First of all, the size of dataset is relatively small. It only contains 2225 documents for 5 categories. Cross validation can solve this problem. Secondly, each category has about 400-500 documents. Althgough the dataset is not imbalanced, stratified cross validation is still needed to ensure the ratio of the data unchanged. In addition, there is no need for ordering data because this dataset is not a time-series or any sort of ordered series. So, stratified 10-fold cross validation is suitable for us.

Because we are going to use the grid search, the cross validation will be run several times. By using the nested cross validation The dataset will be splitted into 3 datasets: the training set, the testing set and the validation set. The inner cv is the training/validation partition, and the outer cv is the validation/testing partition. So, using this method, we can run the program just once to test all parameters and find the winning model.
And we will use the stratified 10-fold cross validation as well.      
The reason for using stratified 10-fold cross validation is this method can guarantee the proportion of the data in 3 sets is as same as the original dataset. So the model we get will fit the dataset.   
According to the above, the nested cross validation with the grid search and stratified 10-fold cross validation are appropriate for us.

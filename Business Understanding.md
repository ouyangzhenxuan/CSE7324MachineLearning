#### Business understanding
Compared with spending on housing, food, and travel, medical expenses are also a big part for Americans. Those sudden emergencies threaten people like the sword of Damocles. Along with the emergency, there is a high medical bill which is unacceptable. Even for medical events within the plan, additional costs may be incurred because of unpredictable processes or results. Therefore, the prediction of medical expenses is extremely important for both patients and medical insurance institutions. Due to the development of data science in recent years, now, medical expenditures can be roughly predicted.

## Business understanding
Compared with spending on housing, food, and travel, medical expenses are also a big part for Americans. Those sudden emergencies threaten people like the sword of Damocles. Along with the emergency, it is a high medical bill that is unacceptable. Even for medical events within the plan, additional costs may be incurred for patients and their families because of unpredictable processes or results. Therefore, the prediction of medical expenditure becomes extremely important. Due to the development of data science in recent years, personal medical expenditures can now be roughly predicted.

This data contains 6 attributes for 1388 people and their medical expenses. These 6 attributes include gender, age, BMI, child, smoking status and location. By visualizing this data, we can discover the intrinsic relationship between these attributes and their impact on health care spending. By analyzing this data, people will have a rough estimate of their medical expenses. Insurance institutions can also launch medical insurance schemes suitable for different groups of people based on the analysis results.

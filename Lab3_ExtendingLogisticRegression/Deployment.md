## Deployment

We will recommand you to use scikit-learn.

According to the above, with the relative same accuracy, the scikit-learn has a faster speed. One of the important reason is that the scikit-learn does all the work on the native language compiled by Cython. 

Additionally, the scikit-learn provides more parameters to choose. So, it can achieve more demands. Our codes only provides several basic parameters.

Last but not least, the scikit-learn has been used on many datasets to prove it is effective. However, we only use our code on one dataset, and there are many parameters are optimized for this dataset. So, we don't know whether it still has a relatively excellent performance on other datasets.

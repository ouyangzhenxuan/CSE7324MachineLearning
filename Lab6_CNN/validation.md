We decide to use stratified 10-fold cross validation. First, the dataset we use has 7 classes. Except class 1, other class have approximately 3000-5000 images. However, class 1 only has 436 images. The dataset is imbalanced. And stratified cross validation can solve this problem. In addition, there is no need for ordering data because this dataset is not a time-series or any sort of ordered series. So, stratified 10-fold cross validation is suitable for us.
